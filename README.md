You can:

  -- Create subclasses of Teacher, like MathTeacher, ScienceTeacher, etc., with additional methods or properties (like yearsOfExperience) specific to each type of teacher.

  -- Implement a method to allow evaluations for each teacher, where you can store ratings, feedback, and comments.
  
  -- Add a Student class, where students are enrolled in different subjects taught by teachers. You can associate students with teachers and track which student is in which class.
