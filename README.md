Codecademy Projects - C++, Javascript, Python  
<br />

These are some code projects from the Codecademy's courses that I saved, either for future reference or because I found them interesting... that and probably because they demanded an extra bit of attention.

Hope they either help you or you enjoy them!!

P.S.: I know that this is not the way one should use github repositories, but I decided to use the branchs as a way to separate the languages and projects.
