Scripting the World
&nbsp;

A game engine for 2D games centers on a well-structured GameObject class, designed to store essential character data such as name, health, position, and animation state, all kept private for clean architecture. Rather than making this data public, specific friend functions and classes are used to allow only trusted systems—like scripting engines or debugging tools—to access and modify these internals directly. This approach maintains encapsulation while enabling flexible interactions, facilitating a powerful yet safe simulation. The engine also features operator overloading to make code more intuitive, closely mimicking the behavior of professional game development tools.

**P.S.:** I know that this is not the way one should use github repositories, but I decided to use the branchs as a way to separate the languages and projects.
