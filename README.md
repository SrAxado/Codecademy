Cross Platform Debugger
&nbsp;

You’re developing a cross-platform tool for developers who need to debug and profile their C++ programs efficiently. Whether it’s Windows, Linux, or macOS, this utility adapts seamlessly.
&nbsp;
By the end of this project, you’ll have a system that logs compile-time information, detects the operating system, measures how long your functions take, and indicates whether you’re in debug mode, all utilizing modern, clean C++ code.

**P.S.:** I know that this is not the way one should use github repositories, but I decided to use the branchs as a way to separate the languages and projects.
