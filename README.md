Codecademy Projects - C++

These are some code projects from the Codecademy's "Learn C++" course that I saved, either for future reference or because I found them interesting... that and because probably they demanded an extra bit of attention.

You'll also be able to find the longer projects isolated, within it's own specific branch.


Hope they either help you or you enjoy them!!
