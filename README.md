Codecademy Projects - C++

These are some code projects from the Codecademy's "Learn C++" course that I saved, either for future reference or because I found them interesting... that and because probably they demanded an extra bit of attention.

You'll also be able to find the longer projects isolated, within it's own specific branch.


Hope they either help you or you enjoy them!!




                --------------------             UFO             --------------------

It’s game time! And by that we mean, it’s time for you to roll up your sleeves and build a game: UFO.
ufo abduction

The premise:

Invaders from outer space have arrived and are abducting humans using tractor beams. Players must crack the codeword to stop the abduction!

Ok, we’ll admit it’s quite a bit like that classic game, “Hangman”, but with a better premise. Plus, building this command-line game was the Codecademy 2019 Software Engineer Internship Backend Programming Challenge!
