Robotics Control System
&nbsp;

A cutting-edge robot factory is prone to occasional malfunctions—some run low on battery, others break down from mechanical strain. You’ve been hired to create a system that gracefully handles these errors! By the end of this project, you’ll have a suite of robots, a central command to manage them, and robust exception handling so the factory can keep rolling.

**P.S.:** I know that this is not the way one should use github repositories, but I decided to use the branchs as a way to separate the languages and projects.
