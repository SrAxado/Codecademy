Codecademy "Data Scientist: Analytics" Carreer Path -- Python  
<br />

These are some code projects from the Codecademy's "Data Scientist: Analytics" Carrer Path that I saved, either for future reference or because I found them interesting... that and probably because they demanded an extra bit of attention.

Hope they either help you or you enjoy them!!... or if you'll be willing give me some feedback about them.

P.S.: I know that this is not the way one should use github repositories, but I decided to use the branchs as a way to separate the languages and projects.
