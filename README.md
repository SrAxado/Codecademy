Master the Palette
&nbsp;

You’ve joined the Palette++ development team, where the existing Color class already handles RGB values and hex codes. Now designers want to work with colors using natural C++ operations. Your task is to overload the necessary operators so users can blend colors with +, brighten them with ++, scale their intensity with *, and compare them easily. After each operation, the RGB channels must always remain within the valid 0–255 range.

**P.S.:** I know that this is not the way one should use github repositories, but I decided to use the branchs as a way to separate the languages and projects.
