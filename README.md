Codecademy Projects - C++

These are some code projects from the Codecademy's "Learn C++" course that I saved, either for future reference or because I found them interesting... that and because probably they demanded an extra bit of attention.

You'll also be able to find the longer projects isolated, within their own branch:

  -- Flight Booking;    
  -- Restaurant Reservations;   
  -- Library Management System; 
  -- Fusion Kitchen;    
  -- Epic Duel; 
  -- The Secure Banking System; 
  -- School Management System.  
&nbsp;

Hope they either help you or you enjoy them!!

P.S.: I know that this is not the way one should use github repositories, but I decided to use the branchs as a way to separate the languages and projects.
