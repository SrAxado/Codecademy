Digital Art Gallery
&nbsp;

In this project, we set to create a simple Digital Art Gallery using C++.
It will help manage different types of artworks such as paintings, sculptures, and digital pieces, while introducing key C++ concepts like constructors through the process of designing and handling art objects.

**P.S.:** I know that this is not the way one should use github repositories, but I decided to use the branchs as a way to separate the languages and projects.
