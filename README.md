EPIC DUEL

Your journey into the world of character battles begins now! In this project, you’ll build an exciting battle game where unique characters clash in epic showdowns. With your newfound knowledge of C++, you’ll create a system that brings together fearsome Warriors and mystical Sorcerers, each with their own special skills and abilities.


You will:

    -- Build a base Character class to lay the foundation for your game’s characters.
    -- Create subclasses like Warrior and Sorcerer to extend the Character class, each with its own unique attack methods and attributes.
    -- Implement polymorphism to allow for flexible character interactions, where each type brings its own twist to battle!
    -- Dive into downcasting to access subclass-specific methods, such as unleashing a Warrior’s special attack or casting a powerful spell.


You’ll have the power to:

    -- Define how characters attack, defend, and clash in epic duels.
    -- Customize each character’s abilities, giving you control over their strategies and combat style.

Prepare for a wild ride as you code your way to becoming the ultimate game master! Let’s get started!
